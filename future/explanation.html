		<p>The Buddha achieved enlightenment after sitting beneath the Bodhi Tree for forty-nine days. Today, perhaps, there is no need for our physical bodies to sit.</p>
		<p>I have created a digital surrogate who will sit in my place. Beginning on April 8th, 2015, the surrogate will begin meditating in a simple chair facing a plain white wall.</p>
		<p>After forty-nine days, the surrogate will achieve non-attachment and I, being indistinguishable from my surrogate, will as well.</p>
		<p>This project exists only on the Internet and thus has no fixed location. Being stored on spinning hard disks, the surrogate will exist with or without a viewer.</p>
		<p>At the end of the forty-eight days, the surrogate will be removed from the server and cease to exist, allowing the storage space to return to its natural, undefined state.</p>
