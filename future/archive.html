		<p>In April, 2015, I set up an infinitely-looping GIF of myself in meditation, facing a plain, somewhat dingy wall. This GIF was set to loop for forty-nine days (the length of time the Buddha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree), at which point it would achieve non-attachment on my behalf. The GIF would then be destroyed.</p>
		<p>With the file deleted, the GIF's false, fleeting existence ended; the storage space it occupied returned to being pure potential.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the intended effect of my own enlightenment, achieved via the surrogate that sat in my place, did not take place. The promise of the digital project, wherein automated stand-ins can achieve our goals for us, has shown its limits.</p>
		<p>This series of pages will remain up as a record of the failed attempt. A copy of the GIF (not the "original") is included. As an extension of the original project, it will meditate indefinitely. Perhaps it will achieve a fuller, truer enlightenment which I can take part in.</p>
